# LeetCode

### Summary
Some of my solutions to [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) problems.

#### Explanation
Most of them will be
done in C++ or C (maybe JavaScript). If the solutions are not readable, it's because
I'm trying to optimize for speed. Seeing as LeetCode provides a run time count, I
like minimizing it. That explains why I use C sometimes; it tends to run the solutions
faster than C++.

#### CMake
I have added a build setup for each solution in CMake that is done in C or C++.
Simply do `cmake .` in root directory and then `make <problem name>` to build the test.


#### Languages
- C++
