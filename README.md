# LeetCode

### Summary
Some of my solutions to [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) problems.

#### Explanation
Most of them will be
done in C++ or C (maybe JavaScript). If the solutions are not readable, it's because
I'm trying to optimize for speed. Seeing as LeetCode provides a run time count, I
like minimizing it. That explains why I use C sometimes; it tends to run the solutions
faster than C++.

#### CMake
I have added a build setup for each solution in CMake that is done in C or C++.
Simply do `cmake .` in root directory and then `make <problem name>` to build the test.

#### Test
The test executable is not suppose to be all encompassing. Just a little thing to verify
that my code mostly works.

#### Disclaimer
As you would expect, this contains solutions to programming problems. LeetCode seems cool
with people discussing and posting solutions to their problems. They have a discussion forum
associated with every problem, for example, [here's](https://leetcode.com/discuss/questions/oj/pascals-triangle)
for their pascal triangle generation problem. So, they would probably be okay with people hosting
solutions on GitHub.

#### Languages
- C++
- C
