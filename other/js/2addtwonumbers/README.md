# Add Two Numbers

## Difficulty
- Medium

### Description
You are given two **non-empty** linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2. Please note that your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

- **Input:** `(2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)`
- **Output:** `7 -> 0 -> 8`
